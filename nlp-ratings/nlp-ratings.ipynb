    "This workshop is focused on the creation, deployment, monitoring and management of a machine learning model for predicting product ratings from reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will be exploring the data, and going through the steps to train the machine learning model itself. We will use a fine tuned DistilBERT hugging face transformer model (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/distilbert), which is a \"is a small, fast, cheap and light Transformer model trained by distilling BERT base\". For the sake of time, we will use a pretrained model rather than training the model in the workshop. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will then deploy our trained model using the Seldon Deploy SDK and view our running deployments in the Seldon Deploy UI. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will deploy a second Tensorflow model with slightly differing architecture as a Canary model to demonstrate the A/B testing functionality Seldon Deploy provides. This time we will deploy direct from the UI. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we will begin to add the advanced monitoring that Seldon Alibi is famed for. \n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we will install and import the relevant packages which we will use throughout the exploration, training, and deployment process. Google Colab comes with a number of packages pre-installed, so we only need to install any additional packages we may need."

    "Although powerful, modern machine learning models can be sensitive. Seemingly subtle changes in a data distribution can destroy the performance of otherwise state-of-the art models, which can be especially problematic when ML models are deployed in production. Typically, ML models are tested on held out data in order to estimate their future performance. Crucially, this assumes that the process underlying the input data `X` and output data `Y` remains constant.\n",
