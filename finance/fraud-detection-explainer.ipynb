    "# Drift Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example you will use Alibi Detect to train a custom drift detector which can flag when the underlying input data distribution has shifted. This can inform decisions about re-training or prompt deeper investigation into data/model behaviours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seldon Deploy also allows you to setup alerts when drift is detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example you will use the Maximum Mean Discrepancy method. Covariate or input drift detection relies on creating a distance measure between two distributions; a reference distribution and a new distribution. The MMD drift detector is no different; the mean embeddings of your features are used to generate the distributions and then the distance between them is measured. The training data is used to calculate the reference distribution, while the new distribution comes from your inference data.\n",
    "\n",
    "More technically, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space is used to generate the mean embeddings, by mapping the highly complex feature space within which most machine learning models operate to a linear Euclidean space. A radial basis function kernel is then used to measure the distance between the two embeddings, and the signifiance of the drift is calculated as a p-value using permutation/resampling tests. More details can be found here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case you will train your drift detector on a sample of 5000 instances from the training set. This has been picked for convenience and speed of training in the workshop, and if this was a production case you would likely want to use the entirety of the training set, or a statistically significant segment."
